# Vehicle-door-handle-control-unit


- <h3> The project aims to implement a vehicle door handle control unit that supports an anti-theft locking capability.
The system consists of the following components: </h3>

  1.  A microcontroller unit.
  2.  Two push buttons, one to simulate the handle lock/unlock button and the other one to simulate the door lock/unlock.
  3. Three LEDs, one to simulate the vehicle lock, one to simulate the hazard lights and one for the vehicle ambient light.
  4.  All the push buttons are connected as active low.
  5.  All the LEDs are connected as active high.
